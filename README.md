## Acknowledgments

# Our project is not that perfect right now, as a result we have some minor bugs:

* If you enter the main page after successfull login you need to enter the system again
* For now, you can not edit description, speciality and photo
* To see the front-end of catalog page you need to run http://localhost:8000/account/catalog  Back end is not ready yet, but for the next sprint it will be fixed
